lidar-processing-suite
======================

The set of subprograms to process lidar data
It can:
1. Operate with elastic lidar data
2. Process raman signals
3. Calculate Lidar Ratio and Angstrom exponent processing both lidar returns.
4. Retrieve vertical ozone concentration

Data processing algorithms use either standard atmospheric model or real vertical
profiles of meteorological parameters.

- Provides simple GUI for interacting with data.
- It can operate in batch mode
